### Q-2 What are SOLID principles? (Most Imp)

Ans: 

SOLID PRINCIPLES

1. SRP Single Responsiblity Principle

    THERE SHOULD NEVER BE MORE THAN ONE REASON FOR A CLASS TO CHANGE

    Video 1: https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-in-java-concepts-hands-on-projects/learn/lecture/14671018#reviewsf

1. OCP Open Closed Principle

    SOFTWARE ENTITIES (Classes, Modules, Methods etc.) SHOULD BE OPEN FOR EXTENSION, BUT CLOSED FOR MODIFICATION

    Video: 2: https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-in-java-concepts-hands-on-projects/learn/lecture/14671018#reviewsf

1. LSP Liskov Substitution Principle

    Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObHQHszbIcE

    In essence, here is what it means:

    They're trying to show us when we should not use Inheritance and when we shouldn't". In other words, "whatever the parent can do, the descendants should be able to do that [and more]".

1. ISP Interface Segregation Principle

    CLIENTS SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO DEPEND UPON INTERFACES THAT THEY DO NOT USE

    Video: https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-in-java-concepts-hands-on-projects/learn/lecture/14670992#reviews    

1. DIP Dependency Inversion Principle

    A. HIGH LEVEL MODULES SHOULD NOT DEPEND UPON LOW LEVEL MODULES. BOTH SHOULD DEPEND UPON ABSTRACTIONS

    B. ABSTRACTIONS SHOULD NOT DEPEND UPON DETAILS. DETAILS SHOULD DEPEND UPON ABSTRACTIONS
